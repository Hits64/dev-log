- Added comprehensive search with relevance scoring and full-text capabilities
- Improved error handling and made search more robust

**Research Findings:**
- **Industry Standard**: LlamaIndex + vector embeddings + hybrid search
- **Best Models**: sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2 for local execution
