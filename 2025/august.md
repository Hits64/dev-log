### docs4ai - Documentation System for AI Workflows

**What I built:**
- Created a comprehensive documentation crawler and search system
- Designed for developers using AI/LLMs who need local access to library docs
- Key features: auto-discovery of docs URLs, 75+ pages/minute crawling, smart indexing

**Technical Highlights:**
- Used `crawl4ai` for high-performance web scraping
- Implemented regex-based keyword extraction and categorization
- Built unified CLI interface with Python argparse
- Created modular architecture (crawler, indexer, search, utils)

**Achievements:**
- Published to GitHub: https://github.com/Hits64/docs4ai
- Clean codebase with proper .gitignore (no pre-crawled content)
- Comprehensive README focused on user setup and use cases
- Successfully tested with Pydantic, FastAPI, GitHub, and Crawl4AI docs

**Learnings:**
- Importance of accurate project descriptions (changed from "AI-powered" to "Built for AI workflows")
- Value of creating tools that enhance AI development without necessarily using AI
- Clean repository structure matters for open source adoption

**Next Steps:**
- Monitor community feedback and issues
- Consider adding more example use cases
- Potentially add GUI interface for non-CLI users

### Development Workflow Setup

**What I did:**
- Created `CLAUDE.md` at HitsAi root level for AI assistant instructions
- Established clear workflow: docs4ai for documentation, dev-log for progress tracking
- Set up systematic approach for future development sessions

**Key Decisions:**
- All documentation needs should go through docs4ai first
- Missing libraries should be added locally before use
- dev-log updates are mandatory after significant work
- Clear separation: docs4ai (tools), dev-log (journal), individual projects

**Benefits:**
- Consistent workflow across AI-assisted sessions
- Local-first documentation approach
- Clear progress tracking
- Better context preservation between sessions

### docs4ai Enhancement Research & Planning

**What I accomplished:**
- Fixed critical async and search bugs in docs4ai
- Successfully downloaded LangChain documentation (45 pages)
- Researched 2025 best practices for documentation indexing systems
- Created comprehensive implementation plan for vector-based semantic search

**Technical Fixes:**
- Fixed async crawler calls by adding `asyncio.run()` wrappers
- Resolved field name mismatches in search (`filename` vs `file`, `keywords` vs `global_keywords`)
- Added comprehensive search with relevance scoring and full-text capabilities
- Improved error handling and made search more robust

**Research Findings:**
- **Industry Standard**: LlamaIndex + vector embeddings + hybrid search
- **Best Models**: sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2 for local execution
- **Key Approach**: 70% semantic + 30% keyword search with re-ranking
- **Performance Target**: <200ms search, 50+ pages/min indexing with embeddings

**Major Deliverable:**
- Created `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` with complete upgrade strategy
- Researched vector databases, RAG systems, and semantic search
- Planned hybrid indexing system combining embeddings + traditional search
- Documented Phase 1-4 implementation roadmap

**Current Status:**
- docs4ai working well: 235 total documents across 5 libraries
- Search quality good but can be 40-60% better with semantic search
- Ready to implement modern vector-based indexing system

**Next Session Priority:**
- Implement Phase 1: Add sentence-transformers and FAISS dependencies
- Create embedding_generator.py module
- Test vector embedding generation with existing documentation
